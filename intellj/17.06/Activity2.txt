1)Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.

A deck is a list of values of each card.

2)Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?
 String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
 String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
 int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
 Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);

3)The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2
(lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has point
value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2, …, 10 are 2, …, 10, respectively. Specify the
contents of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays so that the statement
 Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.

Ranks contain 4 one cards , 4 two cards, 4 three cards and 4 Ace's.The suits contain 13 hearts, 13 spades, 13 diamonds, and 13 clubs.

4)Does the order of elements of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays matter?
 
Yes because their class and their value is a unique identification.
